    <h1>Colonel Meow for President</h1>
    <img src="images/colmeow.PNG" alt="Col Meow" class="center">  
    <p>
      Colonel Meow is setting up a dictatorship, and he needs your help! As with any good and modern dictatorship, we'll be holding an election every four years. We will fudge the numbers so the colonel always wins, but our Propaganda Department appreciates your participation. Smile for the U.N.; we can't have them slapping more sanctions on us.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The Colonel needs your support. The Ministry of Collection will be visiting each citizen of our glorious nation over the next few months. We know that you will gladly share your resources with our great leader. When our leader prospers, everyone prospers. Remember, there is more than one way to skin a cat; so choose wisely in your giving. At the very least we expect the following to be included in your gift:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>5lbs of Cat Food: Wet and Dry.</li>
      <li>Three balls of Yarn.</li>
      <li>Any kind of Declawing Device, i.e. Nail Clippers, Scissors, Pliers, etc.</li>
      <li>ALL Writing Utensils and ALL Paper.</li>
      <li>Every Electronic Device that connects to the internet. The Ministry of Education for Glorious Nation will return your devices to you with improved software at a later date.</li>      
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once again, thank you for your support. The Leash of Light will never overcome the Paw in the <a href="https://google.com">Dark</a>. "We are our own masters."
